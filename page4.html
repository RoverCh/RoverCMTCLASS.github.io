                <p>RPGMaker was free last year but I only found out about it this year, so I'm very annoyed I didn't get it !! I wouldn't have been able to use it tho bc I don't have a laptop/pc.</p>

                <h2>2 The Game Awards are going on today.</h2>
				<p> Compared to previous years there aren't as many categories I was interested in.<p>
				<p> I'm glad WuWa (Wuthering Waves) managed to get a nomination though, it's been out for around 7 months and has managed to do very well despite being less-well know. Though Kuro, the studio that made it has made other games before.</p>
				<p> For the best mobile game awards we have<p/> <br>
				<ul>
					<li><p>&emsp;&emsp;AFK Journey (FARLIGHT/Lilith Games)</p></li>
					<li><p>&emsp;&emsp;Balatro (LocalThunk/Playstack)</p></li>
					<li><p>&emsp;&emsp;Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket (Creatures Inc/TPCI)</p></li>
					<li><p>&emsp;&emsp;Wuthering Waves (Kuro Games)</p></li>
					<li><p>&emsp;&emsp;Zenless Zone Zero (miHoYo)</p></li>
				</ul> <br>
				<p> I wasn't the biggest fan of ZZZ, and I don't place Poke-TCG or Balatro, so I'm hoping WuWa or AFK Journey will win since I've played both. 
				<p> For the Player's Choice (which is 100% fan voted), we have : </p> <br>
				<ul>
					<li><p>&emsp;&emsp;   Black Myth: Wukong (Game Science)</p></li>
					<li><p>&emsp;&emsp;   Genshin Impact (Hoyoverse)</p></li>
					<li><p>&emsp;&emsp;   Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree (From Software)</p></li>
					<li><p>&emsp;&emsp;   Wuthering Waves (Kuro Games)</p></li>
					<li><p>&emsp;&emsp;   Zenless Zone Zero (Hoyoverse)</p></li>
				</ul>
				<p> Being non-mobile games I haven't played Wukong or Elden Ring (or the DLC), so I can't say much on them. However, I do this it's strange that the only non-gacha games to be nomimated this year is 1 full game, and 1 DLC, it's usually more full games. I think this is the first time a DLC hs ever been nominated for this. Makes you wonder if they should make a DLC/extra content category.</p>
				<p> While I haven't played much of Genshin, I don't think it deserves to win at all this year. Natlan was SO dissapointing. Not only do you fumble with the cultural aspect by whitewashing everything, but then you introduce these abilities that ONLY work there?? Definitely not memorable, which is a shame bc they were doing well at the beginning of the year. They've even won a category in previous years. However, despite the Natlan fumble, they've still been winning other awards (like the playstation one).</p>
				<p> There's a lot of ppl that think "Genshin can do no wrong", so I don't doubt that it'll be in the top 3 even if I don't want it to.</p>
				<p> An important thing to note is that for Gacha games, if they win any kind of award, that usually means they're going to send in game-currency to it's users. And anything for those "freemogems" as they say. So a lot of people are gonna be voting for them regardless of how they feel about the game because they want the benefits.</p>
				<p> ZZZ, while I was there for the launch, seems to be a fun game, I like some of the designs, but it wasn't my cup of tea. The fighting is cool though.</p>
				<p> I'd definitly like WuWa to win just so they can show people that "what they're doing is working" so it'll show people that it's a genuinely good game. (Also I want rewards.)</p>
				<p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Note: ZZZ and Genshin were both made by the same company.</p>
				<p> I feel like it makes sense if Wukong and the DLC both win 1st and 2nd place, even if I've never played them, it feels weird for there to be so many on-going gacha games in this category.</p>
				<p> IF this does happen, here's my 3rd place wish. </p>
				<br> <p> IF a Hoyoverse game wins, I want this to happen.
				<ol>
				  <li value="3"><p>&emsp;&emsp;Zenless Zone Zero</p></li>
				  <li value="4"><p>&emsp;&emsp;Wuthering Waves</p></li>
				  <li value="5"><p>&emsp;&emsp;Genshin</p></li>
				</ol>
				
				<br> <p> IF a gacha game wins, I want this to happen.
				<ol>
				  <li value="3"><p>&emsp;&emsp;Wuthering Waves</p></li>
				  <li value="4"><p>&emsp;&emsp;Zenless Zone Zero</p></li>
				  <li value="5"><p>&emsp;&emsp;Genshin</p></li>
				</ol>
				<br> <p> This ^ is of course assuming that a gacha game won't win 1st or 2nd, I feel like there's  moment of "whether that's fair", but I won't complain if WuWa get's 2nd too.</p>

                <h2>2</h2>
                <p>My LEAST favorite trope is half-sibling/foster-siblings/step-siblings romance.</p>
				<p> It's SUPER popular, people just like it for some reason????</p>
				<p> I hate it bc I LOVE the found-family trope, the whole "blood doesn't make you family" stuff"
				<p> but the romance trope Totally undermines that bc their reason for it is "it's fine bc we're not actually related."</p>
				<p> You're still siblings?????? That's gross?????<p>
